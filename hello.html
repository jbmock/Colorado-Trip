<h1>Welcome to Colorful Colorado!</h1>
<h2>All about my trip to Colorado</h2>
<p>
    Last year I visited Colorado for the first time. I stayed in Colorado Springs and visited Manitou Springs to see Pikes Peak. 
    <br>It was by far one of my favorite trips. I wish to go back very soon to do more exploring.</p></br>

<h3>Things I did while in Colorado:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hiked Garden of the Gods</li>
    <li>Walked around downtown Colorado Springs to do some shopping and eat at local restaurants</li>
    <li>Rode the cog railway to the top of Pikes Peak in Manitou Springs</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<h3>My experience of riding the cog railway to the top of Pikes Peak consisted of the following:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Felt great the whole way up and enjoyed the amazing sights</li>
<li>Suffered from altitude sickness and almost passed out once we reached the top</li>
<li>Not thinking, I asked a group of hikers who had just made the trek all the way up by foot if they could spare some water</li>
<li>Met some friendly locals who were on the cog with us that had a backpack full of remedies to help treat altitude sickness</li>
</ol></br>
<h3>Here are a few more pictures of the journey up to the top:</h3>
