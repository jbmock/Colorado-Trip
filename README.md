# Colorado-Trip
I created this project for an introductory assignment for a course I'm taking through MIT xPRO to learn about HTML and CSS. Some of the concepts I learned while creating this project are adding text and images to a webpage, creating links within text, and how to customize the webpage by using different fonts and pops of color.
As I become more fluent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I plan to update this webpage to continue showcasing the new concepts I'm learning in my Full Stack Development with MERN course.
